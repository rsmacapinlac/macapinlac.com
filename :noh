I only post on this site once in a blue moon (according to super scientific research a max of 3 times a year) when I do post, it is usually a result of:

- Heavy procrastination
- A new toy, AND heavy procrastination
- Breakng something that's pretty important AND heavy procrastination

Or some combination of the 3. I'm sure there are some therapy sessions that can get me to the root cause but for now, I'll stick to heavy procrastination (because it lets me update this website when I do).

At the time of this writing, I broke my [homelab](https://github.com/rsmacapinlac/hwhl) Ansible scripts and some of the services stopped working (ugh DNS). I was up until 3am only to give up and restart everything at 8am the next day. Everything is working now.

I also recently found [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) which seems like a better static site generator for me. [Jekyll was good](/2016/01/13/the-website-exists-again-hello-there-old-friend/), but I didn't really like the way it organized it's files. There wasn't anything wrong with it. It just didn't _feel_ right.

Middleman is like Ruby on Rails but with Markdown and static sites. There is a minimalist appeal to it.

I have the advantage with not having a lot of content is that it was pretty easy to manually move all of the content. (all 11 posts. embarassing!) I considered migrating a whole lot of older posts from 2001 but holy smokes most of those posts have zero value. Think twitter stream of conssciousness but on a personal site. 3 days later... I've gone down the [archive.org](https://archive.org/) rabbit hole and will probably migrate _some_ content.

There has been an [interesting feature](https://evantravers.com/articles/2019/11/08/using-git-to-generate-a-changelog-for-your-blog/) that [Evan Travers'](https://evantravers.com/) has had on his site that I lifted and shifted (with one small code change). It just worked and I learned about the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; tags.

Look, this is going to be trully an interative migration approach. I'm a bit rusty with web development and there is a lot to catch up on.
