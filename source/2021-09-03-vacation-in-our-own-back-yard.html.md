I always wonder how many people have actually been a tourist in their own
backyard. I mean, buy a guidebook learn weird obscure facts, see the sights
in your own city.

We are Vancouver, British Columbia locals, and we can do these things at any
time. The reality is closer to the fact that we probably only become tourists
when we have out-of-town visitors and we're forced to research things to take
friends out.

Since this pandemic came, our family (like most people) followed travel
restrictions and stayed within our own province. That usually means: Harrison
Hot Springs, Kelowna, Osoyoos or Vancouver Island. This time around, it was
Victoria.

We've been there before but we only limited ourselves to walking around
downtown, looking through a few shops in Chinatown and the hotel's pool. 

We ended up in a [hop-on hop-off double decker
bus](https://sightseeingvictoria.com/tour/victoria-hop-on-hop-off/). Things we
saw:

* [A big park](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/parks/beacon-hill.html)
* A petting zoo
* [A *really* big totem pole](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/parks/beacon-hill/story-pole.html)
* A bunch of kids publicly performing Sound of Music
* [A castle](https://thecastle.ca/)
* and some [old neighborhoods](https://www.visitoakbayvillage.ca/)

Highly recommend doing the bus tour! Just in-case you didn't know (because I
didn't) the bus had voice over that explains the area that you're in, the
history, with some interesting facts (and cheeky commentary) peppered
throughout. You are not just sitting there staring into the abyss of landmarks
without any context.

The next day, we went to see [those
kids](https://m.facebook.com/events/528265961731607), a treasure hunt in the castle and a
boatload of [Beaver tails](https://beavertails.com) (courtesy of Groupon). 

BTW, if you're close to [328 Taphouse + Grill](https://www.328taphouse.com/) you
_have_ to try the black and blue pizza!

For next time? Well, it's a very bike friendly city. I think we'll bring our
bikes next time and explore the city using bike paths.
