Lately, Iâ€™ve been spiraling into an e-reader rabbit hole, obsessing over a potential upgrade from my trusty [Kobo Sage](https://ca.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-sage). The current frontrunner? The [Boox Go 10.3](https://shop.boox.com/products/go103). It checks all the right boxesâ€”Android support for my DRM-free audiobook and EPUB collection, a bigger screen for manga, and just enough novelty to make me irrationally excited. 

But hereâ€™s the thing: my Kobo still works fine. Perfectly fine! So, can I really justify dropping **$550 CAD** on something I technically donâ€™t need? Also, the real question: Will a larger screen actually improve my manga-reading experience, or am I just trying to rationalize another gadget? Because I have done _that_ before. Maybe the Kobo might accidentally run into a hammer. You never know, accidents happen.

In a moment of tech-induced masochism, I decided to **completely overhaul my Linux setup**. My old workflow was simple: 

1. Install Gnome 
2. Install [AwesomeWM ](https://awesomewm.org/)
3. Install my dotfiles
4. Use AwesomeWM (while still benefiting from Gnomeâ€™s built-in tools)
5. Every 6 months blow it all away, return to step 1

It was a solid setup, but now Iâ€™m taking a different approachâ€”starting with a **barebones OS install**. If youâ€™re curious, Iâ€™m running **Debian 12** with a fresh set of [Ansible scripts](https://github.com/rsmacapinlac/workstation-builder). Thereâ€™s a lot more work involved (since I, uhâ€¦ nuked everything), but the end result should be a cleaner, more streamlined system. Also, if youâ€™re into dot file organization, you might enjoy browsing [my repo](https://github.com/rsmacapinlac/dots). 

A good friend, **ErnieAtLYD**, is back to blogging, and his latest post on [using Obsidian and AI as an accountability coach](https://littleyellowdifferent.substack.com/p/how-i-avoid-being-an-overall-terrible) got me thinking. **Why am I not using Git as my prompt database?** Smart!

## Random Finds & Late-To-The-Party Moments  

I was on an Anya Taylor-Joy kick, but didn't want to rewatch *The Queen's Gambit* (for the 20-nth time). So I picked up two movies: [The Menu (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)) and [The Gorge (2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gorge_(film)). Ok movies, but can we talk about the **10-year age gap between Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy**? 

ðŸŽµ I miss the days when hip-hop had [this vibe](https://youtu.be/-91vymvIH0c?si=50iZc40prHCWy0Cg&t=259).

ðŸ“º Finally caught up and watched **[Solo Leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Leveling_season_1)**. Fun ride! It fills the anime void left by multi-season breaks of *Demon Slayer* and *My Hero Academia*. Yes, my anime tastes are still firmly rooted in the mindset of a 14-year-old boy. Zero regrets.

See you next time, I decide to write something on this website and make it worth the $30 I pay for the domain. (So maybe in 2026?)
