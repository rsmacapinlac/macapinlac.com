It has been a long time since we've seen each other. The last time was at an
airport where you worked a long while ago. I thought about you recently a month
ago, over the holidays. It is hard to believe that you're gone.

I've avoided everything by focusing on work for the last two weeks. Admittedly,
I'm not the best at dealing with situations like this to be honest with you. Not
my best quality, that is for sure. But I took some time off work to see you,
even if it was only for a few minutes. It was the first time since I saw you at
the airport 10+ years ago. I'm ashamed to say it's been that long.

During your viewing people started sharing about you. 

They reminded everyone of the same thing. It seems like you stayed the life and
center of all your friends, the first person on the dance floor, and the guy
surrounded by happiness. 

A genuine person who radiated a kind of energy that pulled friends from
different circles together. This was also evident from the number of text
messages and phone calls that contacted me over the last few weeks to chat about
you. Different people from different walks of my life: A close friend who now
lives far away, my sister-in-law, an old church group friend, an old band mate,
and even a co-worker. 

My memories of you will always revolve around your old Acura Integra, serving in
YFC camps, far travelled SFC conferences, and late night talks with your guitar
in hand. A deep and insightful thinker. A thoughtful and fiercely loyal friend. 

It has been hard the last few days. I hope you have peace wherever you are. I'll
miss you man.
