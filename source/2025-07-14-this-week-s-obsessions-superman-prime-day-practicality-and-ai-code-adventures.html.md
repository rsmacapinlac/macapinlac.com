Well, here we are again. Another collection of things that have completely hijacked my brain. Let's dive in, shall we?

<!-- more //-->

* Caught *[Superman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5950044/)* recently, and honestly? Probably the best Superman movie in a while. They didn't diminish his powers, but somehow he didn't feel too [OP](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OP). You were actually worried he wasn't going to save the day. Coincidentally, Seth Godin dropped this piece about [Superman metaphors](https://seths.blog/2025/07/the-superman-metaphors/) that's kinda Superman-related but just interesting regardless. [No cap](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20cap) - am I using that right?
* Here's how you know you're officially old: my latest shopping spree consisted of **Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries** (read: Buy the cheapest generic brand) and a **travel router**. That is some serious old person energy right there. When did I become the guy who gets genuinely enthusiastic about practical household purchases?
* Here are two $200 things. One is a [forever Game Boy](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date), [endorsed by Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAZRqzcZRKo) and it is SHINY! Another is a 1,505-piece LEGO set that will probably take 3 hours to put together and crumble at the slightest breeze. Which one would I get? Probably the one that reminds me of my childhood in the Philippines buying the Autobot rip-off "AudioRipple". Get it? Cause the character's name is Soundwave? I'll see myself out.

## My Latest AI Experiment: Learning by Not Learning

Here's my current project: I'm using AI to write code in Go, a language I'm unfamiliar with.

Why? Not just because I'm masochistic and enjoy banging my head against the wall trying to vibe with code blindly.

* Forces me to think before coding (revolutionary concept, I know).
* My confusion reveals exactly how little I actually know about programming.
* Will probably end up as either a blog post or another dead repo on GitHub.

Stay tuned to see if something actually comes out of it.

That's what's been ping-ponging around my head lately. Just your standard week of adult ADHD brain scatter.

See you next time I decide to write something that justifies the $30 I pay for this domain. ðŸ‘‹
