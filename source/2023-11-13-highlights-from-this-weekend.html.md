I need a new blog post? Really? Yea, cause if you're going to put your blog on the front of your site. Can you at least write an updated post?

- Setup [TubeArchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist) in the homelab. Pretty slick way to avoid the endless scrolling on YouTube.
- Poker and pizza with the guys. Super rusty, lost on the flop _twice_!
- Kid's had some activities so it was Uber drivering on Saturday. Was still able to check out [Hon's](http://www.honswontonhouse.com/) noodle soup to see if it was the same from the old days. (spoiler: it's the same!)
- Ok, [Fitness+](https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-fitness-plus/) is pretty good. Have been mindlessly following their workouts and [this particular one](https://fitness.apple.com/ca/workout/treadmill-with-emily/1696420298) made me taste blood.
- Updated [this website](https://www.macapinlac.com).

I wonder if it's worth putting a commenting system on this.
