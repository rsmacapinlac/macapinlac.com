  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>Hello! I'm Ritchie Macapinlac, a technology professional, parent, and lifelong learner based in Vancouver, Canada. I believe in thoughtful experimentation and authentic sharing. This site is my digital journal—a place where I document my journey through technology, parenting, productivity, and personal development.</p>
  
  <p>I believe in the power of thoughtful reflection and honest documentation. Whether I'm exploring new technologies, navigating the challenges of parenting, or experimenting with productivity systems, I share my experiences here in the hope that they might resonate with others on similar paths.</p>
  
  <h2>This Site</h2>
  
  <p>This website is built with Middleman, a static site generator that I've come to appreciate for its simplicity and flexibility. It's designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.</p>
  
  <p>The design emphasizes readability and minimalism, with a focus on content over flashy features. I believe that good design should get out of the way and let the content speak for itself.</p>
  
  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  
  <p>This site covers several interconnected themes that shape my thinking and work:</p>
  
  <!-- Dynamic Tag-Based Content Areas -->
  <div class="content-areas">
    <% all_tags_with_descriptions.each do |tag| %>
      <div class="content-area">
        <h3>
          <span class="tag-icon"><%= tag.icon %></span>
          <%= tag.name %>
        </h3>
        <p><%= tag.description %></p>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>
  
  <p>Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my writing or get in touch if you'd like to connect.</p>
