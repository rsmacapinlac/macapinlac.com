Completely admitting that I am procrastinating this evening. It was a pretty
long day at work and there was a big need to unwind.

<!-- more //-->

Didn't feel like reading any of my books tonight.

To occupy the time, here are some random thoughts knocking around:

* I wonder who would be interested in my homelab setup?
* There is a need for processing emails faster. Unfortunately, collecting my thoughts take a while before I can write.
* I am really liking my [Nuphy Air75](https://nuphy.com/products/air75) and my [Mad Noodle MacroPad](https://www.madnoodleprototypes.com/product-page/the-noodle-pad-v1-0-custom-macro-pad). 
* [Usnea (a type of moss)](https://northernwoodlands.org/outside_story/article/old-mans-beard) is a barometer of pollution. Where it grows = clean environment. I guess that is why [a city](https://www.traveljuneau.com/) that can only be accessed via boat / airplane has a crap tonne of it growing.
* Incredibly useful self-hosted tool? [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/). I use it every day to take notes.
* Impostor syndrome is a pain in the arse.
* I'm on one of those command-line ONLY kicks. I've re-setup NeoMutt, imapfilter, offlineimap and msmtp for my email; how do I sort messages into mailboxes again?! 
* I should aspire to write better README's for my projects, even the private ones.

_sigh_
