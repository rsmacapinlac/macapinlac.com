After all the planning and anxiety-inducing research, the day finally arrived. We packed our Tesla Model Y with luggage, snacks, and a healthy dose of optimism, ready to put our ABRP planning to the test on the 1,200-kilometer journey from Vancouver to Edmonton.

## Day 1: Vancouver to Kamloops

We left Vancouver at 8 AM with a full charge (90% - we learned that charging to 100% isn't necessary and actually takes longer). The first leg was familiar territory - the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler, then the Coquihalla Highway to Kamloops.

### First Charging Stop: Hope Supercharger

Our first stop was the Hope Supercharger, about 150 kilometers from Vancouver. ABRP had predicted we'd arrive with 25% battery, but we actually arrived with 32%. The extra range was a confidence booster, and the charging session took about 20 minutes - just enough time for a coffee and bathroom break.

**Lesson Learned:** ABRP's conservative estimates are actually quite accurate, and having that buffer was psychologically important.

### Second Stop: Kamloops Supercharger

The drive to Kamloops was uneventful, and we arrived at the Supercharger with 28% battery (right on target). This was our longest charging session of the day - about 35 minutes to get to 80% for the next leg.

## Day 2: Kamloops to Edmonton

The second day was the real test - 800 kilometers through the mountains and prairies to Edmonton.

### Mountain Driving: Range Anxiety vs. Reality

The drive through the Rockies was where I expected our range to plummet. But the Tesla's regenerative braking on the downhill sections actually helped maintain our battery level. We descended from the mountains with more charge than expected.

**Key Insight:** Mountain driving in an EV is different from gas cars. The regenerative braking on descents helps offset the energy used on climbs.

### Prairie Driving: Efficiency at its Best

Once we hit the prairies, the Model Y's efficiency really shone. Flat terrain, consistent speeds, and minimal elevation changes meant we were getting close to the EPA-rated range. The autopilot feature was a game-changer for the long, straight stretches.

## Charging Infrastructure: Better Than Expected

We were pleasantly surprised by the charging infrastructure along the route:

- **Tesla Superchargers:** Every 150-200 kilometers, well-maintained and fast
- **Alternative Chargers:** Several Electrify Canada and Flo stations as backups
- **Hotel Charging:** Our overnight stop in Kamloops had a Level 2 charger

## Range Anxiety: The Reality

Despite all our planning, we still experienced some range anxiety, especially on the second day. But the Tesla's navigation system and ABRP's predictions were remarkably accurate. We never arrived at a charger with less than 15% battery.

**Pro Tip:** The Tesla's built-in navigation automatically routes you through Superchargers, but ABRP gives you more control over your charging strategy.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Trust the Technology:** Both ABRP and Tesla's navigation were accurate within 5% of actual range
2. **Plan for Comfort:** Arriving with 20-25% battery gave us peace of mind
3. **Charging Takes Time:** Factor in 20-40 minutes per charging stop
4. **Autopilot is Amazing:** Made the long drives much more comfortable
5. **Weather Matters:** Cold weather and headwinds can significantly impact range

## The Verdict

Our first long-distance EV road trip was a success! The Tesla Model Y performed admirably, and the charging infrastructure was more than adequate. While the trip took longer than it would have in a gas car (due to charging stops), the experience was actually more enjoyable.

**Would we do it again?** Absolutely. The combination of autopilot, comfortable interior, and reliable charging made this one of our most pleasant road trips ever.

## What's Next

In the final post of this series, I'll share our return trip experience and provide a comprehensive cost comparison between gas and electric for this route, including charging costs, time considerations, and environmental impact.
