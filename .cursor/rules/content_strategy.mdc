# Content Strategy Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Content Creation Philosophy
- **Always follow established content patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing post structure and formatting
- **Always consider the reader experience**: Write for clarity and accessibility across all devices
- **Authenticity over perfection**: Share genuine experiences and perspectives rather than polished marketing
- **Value-driven content**: Provide actionable insights or meaningful reflection in every piece
- **Documentation as content**: Treat content creation as part of the development process

### Brand Voice Philosophy
- **Professional yet warm**: Knowledgeable without being intimidating
- **Personal digital journal style**: Authentic, curious, thoughtful, and relatable
- **Minimal and grounded**: Focus on substance over style
- **Approachable expertise**: Make complex topics accessible to general audiences

### Content Organization Philosophy
- **Series over standalone**: Group related content into logical series when possible
- **Tag-driven discovery**: Use consistent taxonomy for content organization
- **Chronological with context**: Maintain temporal flow while providing topical connections
- **Progressive disclosure**: Layer information from simple to complex

## Process

### Creating New Content

#### When to Create Content
- **Personal insights**: Significant experiences or lessons learned
- **Technical discoveries**: Solutions, patterns, or approaches worth sharing
- **Project documentation**: Processes, decisions, and outcomes from development work
- **Response posts**: Meaningful engagement with others' content
- **Series content**: Multi-part explorations of complex topics

#### Content Creation Process
1. **Identify the core message**: What insight or experience is worth sharing?
2. **Research existing content**: Check for related posts and series in the archive
3. **Choose appropriate format**: Single post, series part, or project documentation
4. **Draft with reader in mind**: Focus on clarity and value delivery
5. **Apply consistent formatting**: Follow established frontmatter and structure patterns
6. **Review for brand alignment**: Ensure tone and approach match established voice

#### Content Review Process
- **Clarity check**: Can a general audience understand this content?
- **Value validation**: Does this provide actionable insights or meaningful reflection?
- **Authenticity verification**: Does this reflect genuine experience and perspective?
- **Technical accuracy**: Are technical details correct and appropriately explained?

### Content Organization Workflow
1. **Series planning**: Identify when content should be part of a larger series
2. **Tag assignment**: Use consistent taxonomy for content discovery
3. **Cross-referencing**: Link to related posts and external resources
4. **Archive maintenance**: Ensure historical content remains discoverable

### Feature and Major Content Change Process
- For content features or major content changes, follow the Feature Implementation Pattern using the `plan-and-implement-feature` command for planning, checklist, and documentation.

## Templates

### Blog Post Frontmatter

```yaml
---
