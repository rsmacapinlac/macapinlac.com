# CSS Architecture and Methodology Decision

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
- Basic SASS implementation with limited organization
- No formal design system integration patterns
- Limited component-based architecture
- Basic responsive design without systematic approach

### 1.2 Requirements
- Implement structured CSS architecture supporting design system tokens
- Enable efficient theming with CSS custom properties for dark mode
- Provide component-based organization for maintainability
- Support responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
- Follow Middleman asset pipeline best practices for SASS compilation
- Maintain performance while enabling advanced CSS features

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** SASS with Component-based Architecture and CSS Custom Properties

### 2.1 Rationale
- Leverages native Middleman SASS support without additional build complexity
- Enables design system implementation through variables and mixins
- Provides component-based organization for maintainable CSS structure
- CSS custom properties enable runtime theming for dark mode functionality
- Mobile-first responsive patterns built into architecture foundation
- Balances maintainability with performance requirements
- **Supports modifier-based component variations** (e.g., `--minimal` classes for reading-focused layouts)

## 3. Solutions Considered

### 3.1 Option A: SASS with Component Architecture
- **Description:** Use SASS preprocessing with modular component structure and CSS custom properties
- **Pros:**
  - Native Middleman integration with zero build configuration
  - Design system support through SASS variables and mixins
  - Component-based organization improves maintainability
  - CSS custom properties enable runtime theming capabilities
  - Mobile-first responsive patterns integrated into foundation
  - Established development workflow with SASS ecosystem
  - Automatic vendor prefixing through Middleman autoprefixer
- **Cons:**
  - Build step dependency for SASS compilation
  - Requires SASS syntax knowledge and best practices
  - CSS custom properties have limited support in very old browsers

### 3.2 Option B: Plain CSS with Custom Properties
- **Description:** Use vanilla CSS with custom properties for theming and organization
- **Pros:**
  - No build step required for CSS processing
  - Direct browser support without preprocessing
  - Simple implementation with standard CSS approaches
  - Fast development cycle without compilation
- **Cons:**
  - No design system support through variables and mixins
  - Limited code organization and reusability capabilities
  - Manual vendor prefixing and browser compatibility management
  - Difficult to maintain consistent design tokens across components

### 3.3 Option C: Tailwind CSS
- **Description:** Utility-first CSS framework with design system integration
- **Pros:**
  - Comprehensive utility classes for rapid development
  - Built-in design system with spacing and color tokens
  - Excellent responsive design patterns and mobile-first approach
  - Automatic purging of unused CSS for optimal performance
  - Strong community and documentation support
- **Cons:**
  - Requires significant Middleman build process modification
  - Large learning curve for utility-first development approach
  - Complex integration with existing Middleman asset pipeline
  - Overkill for single-author personal site requirements

### 3.4 Option D: CSS-in-JS Solutions
- **Description:** JavaScript-based styling solutions with component integration
- **Pros:**
  - Dynamic styling capabilities with JavaScript integration
  - Component-scoped styles prevent CSS conflicts
  - Modern development patterns with excellent tooling
  - Runtime theme switching with full JavaScript control
- **Cons:**
  - Incompatible with static site generation architecture
  - Requires JavaScript runtime for style rendering
  - Complex build process integration with Middleman
  - Performance overhead from JavaScript style processing

### 3.5 Option E: CSS Modules
- **Description:** Scoped CSS with automatic class name generation
- **Pros:**
  - Automatic CSS scoping prevents style conflicts
  - Component-based organization with clear boundaries
  - Good integration with modern build tools
  - Maintains CSS syntax while providing scoping benefits
- **Cons:**
  - Requires extensive Middleman build configuration
  - Overkill complexity for single-author personal site
  - Limited benefit without component-based JavaScript framework
  - Additional learning curve for module-based development

## 4. Consequences

### 4.1 Positive
- **Design System Integration**: CSS custom properties enable consistent theming across components
- **Component-Based Organization**: Modular structure improves maintainability and reusability
- **Dark Mode Support**: Runtime theme switching without additional build complexity
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Built-in responsive patterns ensure cross-device compatibility
- **Performance Optimization**: SASS compilation with minification for production builds
- **Modifier Pattern Support**: Enables component variations (e.g., `--minimal` classes) without architectural changes

### 4.2 Negative
- **Build Step Dependency**: Requires SASS compilation for development and production
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand SASS syntax and best practices
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Limited support in very old browsers (IE11 and below)
- **Bundle Size**: SASS compilation may increase CSS bundle size if not properly optimized

### 4.3 Risks
- **Browser Compatibility**: CSS custom properties require fallbacks for older browsers
- **Build Process Complexity**: SASS compilation adds step to deployment pipeline
- **CSS Specificity**: Complex selectors may lead to specificity conflicts
- **Performance Impact**: Large CSS bundles may affect page load times

## 5. Implementation Examples

### 5.1 Component Modifier Pattern
The architecture supports modifier-based component variations through consistent naming conventions:

```scss
// Base component
.post {
  // Base styles
}

// Modifier variations
.post--minimal {
  // Reading-focused layout styles
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  line-height: 1.7;
  
  .post-title--minimal {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    font-weight: 700;
  }
  
  .post-navigation--minimal {
    // Distinct navigation styling
  }
}
```

### 5.2 CSS Custom Properties Integration
Design system tokens are implemented through CSS custom properties:

```scss
:root {
  --color-primary: #3B5F7F;
  --color-text: #252525;
  --space-lg: 2rem;
}

.post--minimal {
  color: var(--color-text);
  padding: var(--space-lg);
  
  &:hover {
    color: var(--color-primary);
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Responsive Design Patterns
Mobile-first responsive patterns are built into the architecture:

```scss
.post--minimal {
  // Mobile-first base styles
  font-size: 1rem;
  
  @media (min-width: $breakpoint-md) {
    // Tablet and desktop enhancements
    font-size: 1.125rem;
  }
}
```
