# CSS Architecture and Methodology Decision

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
- Basic SASS implementation with limited organization
- No formal design system integration patterns
- Limited component-based architecture
- Basic responsive design without systematic approach

### 1.2 Requirements
- Implement structured CSS architecture supporting design system tokens
- Enable efficient theming with CSS custom properties for dark mode
- Provide component-based organization for maintainability
- Support responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
- Follow Middleman asset pipeline best practices for SASS compilation
- Maintain performance while enabling advanced CSS features

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** SASS with Component-based Architecture and CSS Custom Properties

### 2.1 Rationale
- Leverages native Middleman SASS support without additional build complexity
- Enables design system implementation through variables and mixins
- Provides component-based organization for maintainable CSS structure
- CSS custom properties enable runtime theming for dark mode functionality
- Mobile-first responsive patterns built into architecture foundation
- Balances maintainability with performance requirements

## 3. Solutions Considered

### 3.1 Option A: SASS with Component Architecture
- **Description:** Use SASS preprocessing with modular component structure and CSS custom properties
- **Pros:**
  - Native Middleman integration with zero build configuration
  - Design system support through SASS variables and mixins
  - Component-based organization improves maintainability
  - CSS custom properties enable runtime theming capabilities
  - Mobile-first responsive patterns integrated into foundation
  - Established development workflow with SASS ecosystem
  - Automatic vendor prefixing through Middleman autoprefixer
- **Cons:**
  - Build step dependency for SASS compilation
  - Requires SASS syntax knowledge and best practices
  - CSS custom properties have limited support in very old browsers

### 3.2 Option B: Plain CSS with Custom Properties
- **Description:** Use vanilla CSS with custom properties for theming and organization
- **Pros:**
  - No build step required for CSS processing
  - Direct browser support without preprocessing
  - Simple implementation with standard CSS approaches
  - Fast development cycle without compilation
- **Cons:**
  - No design system support through variables and mixins
  - Limited code organization and reusability capabilities
  - Manual vendor prefixing and browser compatibility management
  - Difficult to maintain consistent design tokens across components

### 3.3 Option C: Tailwind CSS
- **Description:** Utility-first CSS framework with design system integration
- **Pros:**
  - Comprehensive utility classes for rapid development
  - Built-in design system with spacing and color tokens
  - Excellent responsive design patterns and mobile-first approach
  - Automatic purging of unused CSS for optimal performance
  - Strong community and documentation support
- **Cons:**
  - Requires significant Middleman build process modification
  - Large learning curve for utility-first development approach
  - Complex integration with existing Middleman asset pipeline
  - Overkill for single-author personal site requirements

### 3.4 Option D: CSS-in-JS Solutions
- **Description:** JavaScript-based styling solutions with component integration
- **Pros:**
  - Dynamic styling capabilities with JavaScript integration
  - Component-scoped styles prevent CSS conflicts
  - Modern development patterns with excellent tooling
  - Runtime theme switching with full JavaScript control
- **Cons:**
  - Incompatible with static site generation architecture
  - Requires JavaScript runtime for style rendering
  - Complex build process integration with Middleman
  - Performance overhead from JavaScript style processing

### 3.5 Option E: CSS Modules
- **Description:** Scoped CSS with automatic class name generation
- **Pros:**
  - Automatic CSS scoping prevents style conflicts
  - Component-based organization with clear boundaries
  - Good integration with modern build tools
  - Maintains CSS syntax while providing scoping benefits
- **Cons:**
  - Requires extensive Middleman build configuration
  - Overkill complexity for single-author personal site
  - Limited benefit without component-based JavaScript framework
  - Additional learning curve for module-based development
