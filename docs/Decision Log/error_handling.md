# Error Handling and Monitoring Strategy Decision

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
- Basic GitHub Actions for build and deployment
- No systematic error monitoring or alerting
- Limited build-time validation beyond basic syntax checking
- No runtime error detection for static site issues

### 1.2 Requirements
- Implement error detection and prevention for build and deployment processes
- Establish monitoring strategy appropriate for static site architecture
- Provide graceful degradation patterns for JavaScript-dependent features
- Enable quick rollback capability for deployment issues
- Follow static site best practices for error handling without server-side monitoring
- Maintain cost-effective approach suitable for personal site scale

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** GitHub Actions Validation with Build-time Error Detection and Graceful Degradation

### 2.1 Rationale
- Leverages existing GitHub Actions infrastructure for automated validation
- Provides pre-deployment error detection preventing broken deployments
- Git-based rollback capability enables quick recovery from issues
- Static site architecture inherently eliminates server-side error categories
- Progressive enhancement patterns handle JavaScript failures gracefully
- Cost-effective approach suitable for personal site without additional service dependencies

## 3. Solutions Considered

### 3.1 Option A: GitHub Actions Build Validation
- **Description:** Comprehensive build-time validation with automated testing and graceful degradation patterns
- **Pros:**
  - Pre-deployment validation prevents broken site deployments
  - Integrated with existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
  - Git-based version control enables immediate rollback capability
  - Static site architecture eliminates server-side failure categories
  - Progressive enhancement patterns handle JavaScript-dependent features
  - Cost-effective with no additional service dependencies
  - Automated link checking and content validation capabilities
- **Cons:**
  - Limited runtime error detection for user-facing issues
  - Depends entirely on build process for error prevention
  - No real-time monitoring of live site performance
  - Manual intervention required for post-deployment issue detection

### 3.2 Option B: Third-party Monitoring Service
- **Description:** External monitoring service with real-time alerts and performance tracking
- **Pros:**
  - Real-time monitoring of site availability and performance
  - Automated alerting for downtime or performance degradation
  - Detailed analytics on user experience and site performance
  - Advanced monitoring features like synthetic testing
  - Geographic monitoring from multiple locations worldwide
- **Cons:**
  - Additional cost and service dependency for personal site
  - Overkill complexity for static site monitoring requirements
  - Limited value for static content without dynamic functionality
  - Vendor lock-in with potential service discontinuation risk

### 3.3 Option C: Server-side Error Logging
- **Description:** Traditional server-side error logging and monitoring infrastructure
- **Pros:**
  - Comprehensive error tracking for dynamic applications
  - Detailed request and response logging capabilities
  - Real-time error alerting and notification systems
  - Advanced debugging and troubleshooting capabilities
- **Cons:**
  - Not applicable to static site architecture
  - Requires server-side infrastructure and maintenance
  - Unnecessary complexity for static content delivery
  - Additional hosting costs and configuration requirements

### 3.4 Option D: Manual Testing and Monitoring
- **Description:** Manual testing procedures without automated validation or monitoring
- **Pros:**
  - Simple implementation without additional tools or services
  - Complete control over testing procedures and validation
  - No additional dependencies or service costs
  - Flexible testing approach adapted to specific site requirements
- **Cons:**
  - Time-consuming and error-prone manual processes
  - Inconsistent testing coverage across site updates
  - No automated prevention of deployment issues
  - Does not scale with site growth or complexity

### 3.5 Option E: Hybrid Monitoring Approach
- **Description:** Combination of automated build validation with selective third-party monitoring
- **Pros:**
  - Balances automated validation with runtime monitoring
  - Flexible approach allowing gradual enhancement
  - Cost-effective with targeted monitoring for critical features
  - Provides both pre-deployment and runtime error detection
- **Cons:**
  - Increased complexity with multiple monitoring approaches
  - Potential for monitoring overlap and configuration conflicts
  - Higher maintenance overhead for multiple monitoring systems
  - Additional costs for third-party monitoring components
