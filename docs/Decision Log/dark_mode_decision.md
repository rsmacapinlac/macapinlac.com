# Dark Mode Implementation Technical Decision

**Status:** Approved  
**Type:** Technical Implementation

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
- Single light mode with yellow background
- No user preference detection or storage
- Static color scheme throughout site without theme flexibility

### 1.2 Requirements
- Implement dark/light mode toggle following modern web development best practices
- Default to light mode on first visit per design system specifications
- Provide smooth transitions between modes with proper duration
- Maintain state persistence across browser sessions
- Support system preference detection for automatic theme selection
- Ensure complete color mapping for all UI elements with proper contrast ratios
- Follow Middleman asset pipeline best practices for CSS organization

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** CSS Custom Properties + JavaScript

### 2.1 Rationale
- Provides efficient runtime theme switching without requiring page reloads
- Enables complete user control over theme preference with state persistence
- Supports both manual toggle and automatic system preference detection
- Maintains excellent performance with minimal JavaScript payload
- Offers smooth transitions while respecting reduced motion preferences
- Allows progressive enhancement with graceful degradation for JavaScript-disabled browsers
- Aligns with Middleman's modern frontend development approach

## 3. Solutions Considered

### 3.1 Option A: CSS Custom Properties + JavaScript
- **Description:** Use CSS variables for theming with JavaScript for user control and persistence

  - Progressive enhancement with JavaScript-disabled fallback
  - Minimal performance impact and fast theme switching
  - Support for system preference detection and automatic switching
  - Follows modern CSS best practices
  - Compatible with Middleman's asset pipeline
- **Cons:**
  - Requires JavaScript for full functionality
  - CSS custom properties have limited support in very old browsers
  - Slightly more complex implementation than static approaches

### 3.2 Option B: Separate Stylesheets

  - More complex maintenance when adding new themed elements
  - Less flexible than custom properties for dynamic theming

### 3.4 Option D: Automatic System Theme Only
- **Description:** Rely solely on CSS media queries for system preference detection
- **Pros:**
  - Zero JavaScript required for theme detection
  - Automatic theme switching based on system preferences
  - Excellent performance with no runtime overhead
  - Simple implementation with CSS media queries only
  - Follows progressive enhancement principles
- **Cons:**
