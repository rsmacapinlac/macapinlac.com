# Image and Asset Management Strategy Decision

## 1. Context / Background

### 1.1 Current State
- Basic image storage in source/images directory
- No systematic optimization or processing pipeline
- Manual image handling without consistent sizing or format standards
- Limited responsive image support

### 1.2 Requirements
- Implement image optimization strategy balancing quality and performance
- Establish responsive image sizing for various screen densities
- Maintain accessibility standards with descriptive alt text
- Support multiple image formats for optimal delivery
- Integrate with existing Git-based content workflow
- Follow Middleman static site best practices for asset management

## 2. Decision

**Selected Solution:** Manual Image Optimization with Responsive Sizing Standards

### 2.1 Rationale
- Maintains simplicity while ensuring optimal image quality and file sizes
- Provides complete control over image optimization and format selection
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Git-based content management workflow
- Enforces accessibility standards through manual alt text creation
- Avoids complex build pipeline modifications that could introduce instability
- Balances performance optimization with development workflow simplicity

## 3. Solutions Considered

### 3.1 Option A: Manual Optimization with Standards
- **Description:** Manual image optimization with established sizing and format guidelines
- **Pros:**
  - Complete control over image quality and optimization settings
  - Simple integration with existing Git-based content workflow
  - No build process modifications or additional dependencies
  - Consistent accessibility through enforced alt text standards
  - Optimal file sizes through careful manual optimization
  - Flexible format selection based on content requirements
  - Immediate workflow integration without learning curve
- **Cons:**
  - Manual effort required for each image optimization
  - Potential for inconsistent optimization across different authors
  - No automatic responsive image generation
  - Depends on author discipline for consistent standards

### 3.2 Option B: Automated Image Pipeline
- **Description:** Build-time image processing with automatic optimization and responsive sizing
- **Pros:**
  - Automatic optimization ensures consistent file sizes and quality
  - Responsive image generation for multiple screen densities
  - Format conversion and modern format support (WebP, AVIF)
  - Batch processing capabilities for existing image libraries
  - Consistent optimization standards across all images
- **Cons:**
  - Significant complexity added to Middleman build process
  - Additional dependencies and potential build instability
  - Complex configuration required for optimization settings
  - Slower build times with image processing overhead
  - Learning curve for new pipeline configuration and maintenance

### 3.3 Option C: External Image Service
- **Description:** Third-party CDN service with automatic optimization and delivery
- **Pros:**
  - Automatic optimization and format selection based on browser
  - Global CDN delivery for improved performance worldwide
  - Responsive image generation and delivery
  - Advanced features like lazy loading and progressive enhancement
  - No build process impact or local optimization requirements
- **Cons:**
  - External service dependency and potential vendor lock-in
  - Ongoing costs for image processing and delivery
  - Loss of control over image optimization settings
  - Complex migration if service discontinuation occurs
  - Privacy concerns with third-party image processing

### 3.4 Option D: Unoptimized Image Storage
- **Description:** Store images directly without optimization or processing
- **Pros:**
  - Simplest possible implementation with no optimization overhead
  - Zero build process modifications or additional dependencies
  - Immediate integration with existing content workflow
  - No learning curve or configuration requirements
- **Cons:**
  - Poor performance impact from large unoptimized images
  - No responsive image support for different screen sizes
  - Inconsistent image quality and format standards
  - Negative impact on page load times and user experience

### 3.5 Option E: Progressive Image Enhancement
- **Description:** Basic optimization with progressive enhancement for advanced features
- **Pros:**
  - Balances simplicity with performance optimization
  - Gradual enhancement pathway for future improvements
  - Maintains simple workflow while enabling optimization
  - Flexible approach allowing future pipeline integration
- **Cons:**
  - Requires establishing optimization standards and guidelines
  - Manual effort still required for image preparation
  - Limited automation for consistent optimization
  - Potential for incomplete optimization implementation
