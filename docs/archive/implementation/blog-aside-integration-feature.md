pageable: true
per_page: 12
layout: sidebar_layout
---

<% content_for :sidebar do %>
  <div class="sidebar-section">
    <h3>Browse by Category</h3>
    <%= partial 'layouts/blog_aside' %>
  </div>
<% end %>

<div class="page-main-content">
  <!-- Main content structure -->
</div>
```

### 2. Fix Year Navigation Path [COMPLETE]
**Status**: Complete  
**File**: `source/layouts/blog_aside.erb`

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: blog_year_path Helper [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: The blog_aside.erb references `blog_year_path(year)` which is not defined
**Root Cause**: Year-based routing is commented out in config.rb, but calendar template exists
**Solution**: Replaced `blog_year_path(year)` with `/calendar.html?year=#{year}` to use existing calendar template
**Status**: Resolved - implemented correct path

### Challenge 2: Sidebar Content Organization [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: Need to organize sidebar content with proper sections
**Root Cause**: Blog aside needs to be integrated with existing sidebar structure
**Solution**: Wrapped blog aside in `sidebar-section` container with appropriate heading
**Status**: Resolved - properly integrated with existing sidebar patterns

### Challenge 3: Header Alignment [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: Writing page header had different margin than about/contact pages
**Root Cause**: Writing page used `page-header` wrapper while others used direct h1
**Solution**: Removed `page-header` wrapper to match other pages
**Status**: Resolved - headers now align consistently

### Challenge 4: Sidebar Space Usage [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: Tags list was causing sidebar to scroll past main content
**Root Cause**: Large list items with too much spacing
**Solution**: Implemented compact grid layout with smaller fonts and tighter spacing
**Status**: Resolved - sidebar is now compact and efficient

### Challenge 5: Year Navigation 404 [RESOLVED]
**Problem**: Year links were returning 404 errors
**Root Cause**: `blog.year_link` was commented out in config.rb
**Solution**: Enabled year_link configuration and updated links to use correct format
**Status**: Resolved - year links now work correctly

## Lessons Learned

- **Existing Infrastructure**: The blog_aside.erb was already well-designed but unused. Leveraging existing components can save significant development time.
- **Path Resolution**: When encountering undefined helpers like `blog_year_path`, check existing templates and routing configurations for the correct approach.
- **Sidebar Integration**: The existing sidebar layout system is flexible and can easily accommodate new content sections.
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing of navigation links is crucial for ensuring user experience works as expected.
- **Header Consistency**: Maintaining consistent header structure across pages is important for visual alignment and user experience.
- **Space Efficiency**: Compact layouts in sidebars are crucial for preventing scrolling issues and maintaining good UX.
- **Configuration Dependencies**: Some features require specific configuration settings to be enabled (like year_link) for proper functionality.
