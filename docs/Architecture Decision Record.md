## ADR-005: URL Structure Design

**Date:** 2024-12-XX  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Ritchie Macapinlac  

### Context

URLs needed to be SEO-friendly, human-readable, and support content organization.

### Decision

**Use hierarchical URL structure: `/{year}/{month}/{day}/{title}.html`**

### Rationale

- **SEO Optimization**: Search engines prefer hierarchical, descriptive URLs
- **Human Readability**: URLs clearly indicate content date and topic
- **Content Organization**: Natural chronological and topical grouping
- **Future-Proof**: Supports archive and category pages
- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable URL patterns for users

### Alternatives Considered

- **Flat Structure**: `/post-title.html` - less SEO-friendly
- **Category-Based**: `/category/post-title.html` - more complex organization
- **Slug-Only**: `/post-slug.html` - loses chronological context

### Consequences

- **Positive**: Better SEO, clear content organization
- **Negative**: Longer URLs, requires careful title slugification
- **Neutral**: Slightly more complex routing logic
