### **1. Project Overview**

**macapinlac.com** is a personal blog by Ritchie Macapinlac that mixes thoughtful, often humorous reflections on technology, parenting, productivity, and personal development. It serves as both a public digital journal and a resource for fellow curious minds—featuring deep dives into EV road trips, Docker guides, and daily-life experiments in living and working smarter.

This redesign will transform macapinlac.com into a contemporary digital space that balances clarity, authenticity, and sophistication.
