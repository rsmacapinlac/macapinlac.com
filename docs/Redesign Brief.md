### **1. Project Overview**

**macapinlac.com** is a personal blog by Ritchie Macapinlac that mixes thoughtful, often humorous reflections on technology, parenting, productivity, and personal development. It serves as both a public digital journal and a resource for fellow curious minds—featuring deep dives into EV road trips, Docker guides, and daily-life experiments in living and working smarter.

This redesign will transform macapinlac.com into a contemporary digital space that balances clarity, authenticity, and sophistication. The updated site will reflect Ritchie’s evolving professional identity while supporting a growing body of writing and new content formats. The tone and presentation should remain grounded, personal, and accessible—never overly polished or corporate.

### **2. Objectives and Goals**

* **Enhance User Experience (UX):** Simplify navigation and optimize the reading experience across all devices.
* **Modernize Visual Identity:** Align the visual look and feel with Ritchie’s personality and current body of work.
* **Grow and Engage Readership:**

  * Introduce a **newsletter sign-up** to build a mailing list and deepen audience connection (as a secondary/tertiary call to action).
  * Design with **commenting or reader feedback** functionality in mind (but do not implement yet).

  * Highlight ongoing or past **projects** and potential content **series** to demonstrate depth and continuity in Ritchie’s work.

### **6. New Additions to Content Structure**

* **Newsletter Sign-Up**
  Tasteful opt-in on homepage and blog posts (suggested: end of article or inline). Integration with a simple newsletter tool. Positioned as a **secondary or tertiary call to action**, ideally non-intrusive but effective in encouraging subscriptions.

  * Personal experiments or tech builds
  * Highlights of co-op program work or innovation themes
  * Option to include tags or filters for topical browsing

### **7. Context & Rationale**

* Current site is minimal but outdated; lacks warmth and depth to reflect Ritchie’s current writing and direction.
* This redesign will elevate the experience without losing the honest, approachable charm of the original site.
* A more modular design allows the site to grow with Ritchie’s ideas and evolving content strategy.
